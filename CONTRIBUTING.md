## 📐 Coding Standards

To ensure code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following:

*   **Style Guide:** We use ESLint and Prettier. Run `npm run lint` before committing.
*   **File Naming:** Use `PascalCase` for components (e.g., `ValuationCard.jsx`) and `camelCase` for utilities (e.g., `calculateMetrics.js`).
*   **Comments:** Write meaningful comments for complex logic. Explain *why*, not just *what*.
*   **Hooks:** Keep custom hooks in `src/hooks/` and prefix them with `use`.
